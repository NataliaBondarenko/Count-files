Version history:
================


---
v.1.4 -
 * countfiles.py (renamed to __main__.py):
    - Changed the counter data structure in ``word_counter.py`from a dictionary
      to a `collections.Counter()`, which allowed to simplify a few functions:
      `count_word()`, `sort_by_frequency()`, `sort_by_word()`, `show_total()`;
    - Removed unused `import datetime`;
    - Removed unused `exit()`.
    - File and directory exclusion was rewritten.
 * word_counter.py:
    - Replaced `return len(files)` with `return 0` (if no files were found);
    - Removed unused `import datetime`.
 * Added `utils/__init__.py`.
 * Added the ability to show previews both for text and binary files.
 * Simplified `get_file_extension()`.
 * Added `requirements.txt`.
 * Changed expected behaviour in test for ".gitignore" (it is considered a
   hidden file with no extension).
 * Moved all code files into their own folder.
 * Added a function to check if file has extension.
 * Reduced number of test files.
 * New tests for functions in test_some_functions.py:
    - added def test_has_extension();
    - added def test_get_files_without_extension() and def test_get_files_without_extension_recursive().
 * Changed asserts in test functions according to new dataset.
 * `test_get_files_by_extension()` and `test_get_files_by_extension_nr()` in
   `test_word_counter.py` - updated for check "no extension" search.
 * Added `ArgumentParser` test related for `-fe` .:
    - `test_countfiles_fe_dot()` in `test_argument_parser.py`.
 * Added 1 test for hidden files:
    - `test_for_hidden()` in `test_argument_parser.py`;
    - TODO: add 1 hidden file and check it on Unix.

 * Updated `tests/data_for_tests_statistics.txt`.
 * Added preliminary version of `is_hidden()` and change code to reference this function.
    - TODO: there seems to be a test failing, probably related to this.

v.1.3 - 07/05/2018
(Contributed by Natalia Bondarenko)
 * Added .gitignore.
 * Unit tests:
    - dataset for tests, test cases for `ArgumentParser`, `WordCounter`, some functions (positive testing);
    - added return statement in some functions for testing purposes.
 * Utils:
    - transfer functions that do not belong to any class in utils (`get_file_extension` and `human_mem_size`);
    - added decorator to intercept `KeyboardInterrupt` and common Exceptions;
    - class `WordCounter` moved to separate file.
 * To run the main program thread, the function `main_flow(args)` was created.
 * Added some type hints.

(Special thanks to Natalia Bondarenko, Fred Cirera and Sridhar Ratnakumar)
 * Option to search for files that have a certain extension (.html, .py, .css),
   listing their paths and sizes, and a summary in the end with some basic,
   human readable, file statistics.
 * Option to display a short preview for each found file, when using the new
   search by file extension feature.
 * Option to specify the number of characters to be displayed when using the
   new file preview feature.
 * Reordered and added long version to CLI arguments.

 * Accepts CLI arguments.
 * If no path is passed in the arguments, it will scan the current working directory.
 * Shows a table listing all found file extensions and their frequencies, and the total
   number of files.
 * Counts files recursively through subdirectories, grouping them by file extension.
 * Option to include hidden files (disabled by default).
 * Option to disable recursion (recursion enabled by default).
 * Option do disable table display (table enabled by default).
 * Option to sort the table alphabetically (by default, the table is sorted by frequency).
