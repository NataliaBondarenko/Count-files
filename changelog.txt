================


---
v.1.4 -
 * countfiles.py:
    - Changed the counter data structure in ``ord_counter.py`from a dictionary
      to a `collections.Counter()`, which allowed to simplify a few functions:
      `count_word()`, `sort_by_frequency()`, `sort_by_word()`, `show_total()`;
    - Removed unused `import datetime`;
    - Removed unused `exit()`.
 * word_counter.py:
    - Replaced `return len(files)` with `return 0` (if no files were found);
    - Removed unused `import datetime`.
 * Added `utils/__init__.py`.

---
v.1.3 - 07/05/2018
(Contributed by Natalia Bondarenko)
 * Added .gitignore.
 * Unit tests:
    - dataset for tests, test cases for `ArgumentParser`, `WordCounter`, some functions (positive testing);
    - added return statement in some functions for testing purposes.
 * Utils:
    - transfer functions that do not belong to any class in utils (`get_file_extension` and `human_mem_size`);
    - added decorator to intercept `KeyboardInterrupt` and common Exceptions;
    - class `WordCounter` moved to separate file.
 * To run the main program thread, the function `main_flow(args)` was created.
 * Added some type hints.
