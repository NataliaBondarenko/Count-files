# Count Files [![Github commits (since latest release)](https://img.shields.io/github/commits-since/victordomingos/Count-files/latest.svg)](https://github.com/victordomingos/Count-files)

A little command-line interface (CLI) utility written in Python to help you
count files, grouped by extension, in a directory. By default, it will count
files recursively in current working directory and all of its subdirectories,
and will display a table showing the frequency for each file extension (e.g.:
.txt, .py, .html, .css) and the total number of files found. Any hidden files
or folders are ignored by default.

Supported operating systems: Linux, Mac OS, Windows.

## Description:

Optionally, you can pass it a path to the directory to scan. If you prefer, you can leave that argument empty, and it will scan the current working directory.

The optional `-nr` or `--no-recursion` switch argument tells the
application not to scan recursively through the subdirectories.

By default, the table will be sorted by the file extension frequency. If you
prefer alphabetically sorted results, you just need to add the `-alpha` or `--sort-alpha` 
argument.

Similarly, the optional `-nt` or `--no-table` switch tells the application
not to show a table listing all the found file extensions and their respective
frequencies, so that it will only display the total number of files.
  
  
### Hidden files and directories  

By default, it will ignore files and directories that are supposed to be
hidden, but you can add the `-a` or `--all` optional
switch argument to make it count all files.

Windows: files and directories for which FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN is true  
Linux, Mac OS: those with names starting with "."(dot)
  
  
### Customizing display of results and operation feedback

This utility can also be used to search for files that have a certain file extension
(using `-fe` or `--file-extension`) and, optionally, display a short preview (`-p`or 
`--preview`) for text files. The size of the preview text sample can optionally be
customized by using the `-ps` or `--preview-size` argument followed by an integer number 
specifying the number of characters to present.

The list of file types for which preview is available can be viewed with the `-st` or `--supported-types` argument.
The names of extensions are case sensitive. The results for `ini` and `INI` will be different.

By default, the result of a search by certain file extension is a list with the full paths of the files found.
If you only need the total number of files, use the `-nl` or `--no-list` argument.

The program's operating indicator is printing processed file names in one line.
File names are not displayed when searching for a particular extension, if there are no such files in the folder or if the files are hidden, and the argument `--all` is not specified.

Feedback is available by default for counting files by extension(table and no-table),
searching for files by extension(viewing mode no-list). Optional argument `-nf` or `--no-feedback` disables it.

Using the arguments `--no-feedback` and `--no-list` allows you to speed up the processing of files a little.

### Counting how many files are there for each extension

Count all files in current working directory and all of its subdirectories, ignoring hidden files and hidden subdirectories:

`countfiles`


Count all files in current working directory and all of its subdirectories, including hidden files and hidden subdirectories:

`countfiles -a`  
`countfiles --all`


Count all files in current working directory, ignoring hidden files and hidden subdirectories, and without recursing through subdirectories:

`countfiles -nr`  
`countfiles --no-recursion`


Count all files in a given directory with recursion:

`countfiles ~/Documents`


Count all files in a given directory with recursion, but don't display a table, only the total number of files:

`countfiles -nt ~/Documents`  
`countfiles --no-table ~/Documents`


Count all files in a given directory without recursing through subdirectories, and sort the table alphabetically:

`countfiles -nr -alpha ~/Documents`  
`countfiles --no-recursion --sort-alpha ~/Documents`


Count all files in a given directory without recursing through subdirectories, including hidden files, and only displaying the total number of files (no table):

`countfiles -nr -nt -a ~/Documents`  
`countfiles --no-recursion --no-table --all ~/Documents`


Count all files in a given directory with recursion, ignoring hidden files and hidden subdirectories, without feedback:

`countfiles -nf ~/Documents`  
`countfiles --no-feedback ~/Documents`


### Searching for files with a specific extension

Search recursively for any files that have a `.txt` extension, in a given directory, without list and without feedback:

`countfiles -nf -nl -fe txt ~/Documents`  
`countfiles --no-feedback --no-list --file-extension txt ~/Documents`


Search recursively for any files that have a `.css` extension, in a given directory:

`countfiles -fe css ~/Documents`  
`countfiles --file-extension css ~/Documents`


Search recursively for any files that have a `.py` extension, in a given directory, and display a 500 characters preview for each one:

`countfiles -fe py -p -ps 500 ~/Documents`   
`countfiles --file-extension py --preview --preview-size 500 ~/Documents`


### Searching and listing files without extension

Search recursively for any files that don't have any extension, in a given directory:

`countfiles -fe .  ~/Documents`  
`countfiles --file-extension . ~/Documents`


### Searching and listing all files

Recursively searching all files with extension or without it, in a given directory:  
(similar to counting recursively for any files, but the result is a list with paths)

`countfiles -fe ..  ~/Documents`  
`countfiles --file-extension .. ~/Documents`


## Installation and dependencies:

The current development version can be installed with `pip install -e`, followed by the path to the main project directory (the same directory that has the `setup.py` file). To run this application, you need to have a working Python 3.6+ instalation. We try to keep the external dependencies at a minimum, in order to keep compatibility with different plataforms, including Pythonista on iOS. At this moment, we require:

- puremagic==1.4

We plan to submit this to PyPI as soon as possible, in order to provide a more straight-forward instalation and upgrade process. While that doesn't happen, please feel free to take a look at the next section and maybe consider contributing to this project.
